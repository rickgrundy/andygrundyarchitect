      <h2>Profile</h2>

<p>
  Andy Grundy gained his Diploma in Architecture in Manchester in 1976 and began his career at Trafford Borough Council, rising to team leader.
</p>

<p>
  This was followed by working in several private practices, during which time he developed a keen interest in the design of private houses.
</p>

<p>
  He has obtained planning permission and building regulation approval for hundreds of domestic projects, ranging from small extensions and conversions through to substantial new build houses.
</p>

<p>
  Many of his commissions have been through the personal recommendation of satisfied clients, and this continues to be his main source of new work.
