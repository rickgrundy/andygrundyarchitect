      <h2>Normal Process</h2>

<p>
  Initial discussion of your requirements by telephone and provision of an approximate quotation for architect's and council fees.
</p>

<p>
  Meeting on site to further discuss the project and confirm the fees, and also advise other likely expenses for structural calculations, ecological reports etc.
</p>

<p>
  Carry out a measured &amp; photographic survey of the existing building or site.
</p>

<p>
  Prepare sketch proposals for the project and meet to discuss and agree any amendments required.
</p>

<p>
  Further meeting to present finalised drawings for the planning application, and to collect the planning application fee and this stage of the architect's fees.
</p>

<p>
  Submit the Planning Application, acting as your agent in dealings with the council. (Some extensions are classed as Permitted Development and will not require Planning Permission, but will probably require Building Regulations approval).  The council will normally take up to 8 weeks to give a decision on the Planning Application.
</p>

<p>
  After Planning Permission has been granted, more detailed drawings and specification are required for the Building Regulations application, which will be submitted on your behalf. This also requires a fee to the council and a further architect's fee. The council will normally take up to 8 weeks to give a decision on the Building Regulations Application.
</p>

<p>
  Also at this stage liason with a structural engineer will be undertaken to obtain calculations if required for any structural works, and the engineer's fee advised. Contractors should then be able to provide accurate quotes for the work.
</p>


<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>
  As each project is different, it is not possible to give a schedule of standard fees, but we will be happy to discuss your requirements and provide a reasonable quote for each particular project.
