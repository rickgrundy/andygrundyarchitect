      <h2>Process + Fees</h2>

<p>
  As each project is different, it is not possible to give a schedule of standard fees, but we will be happy to discuss your requirements and provide a reasonable quote for each particular project.
</p>

<p>
  In general, projects proceed as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial discussion by telephone</strong> of your requirements and approximate quotation for architect's and council fees.</li>
  
	<li><strong>Meeting on site to discuss the project,</strong> confirm fees and advise other likely expenses for structural calculations, ecological reports etc.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Measured + photographic survey</strong> of the existing building or site.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Meeting to discuss sketch proposals</strong> and agree any amendments required.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Meeting to present finalised drawings</strong> for the planning application, and to collect fees for the planning application and also for the architectural work done so far.</li>
	
	<li>
	  <strong>Submit Planning Application</strong> acting as your agent in dealings with the council. The council will normally take up to 8 weeks to give a decision on the Planning Application.
	  <br/>
	  NB: Some extensions are classed as Permitted Development and will not require Planning Permission, but will probably require Building Regulations approval.
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>Building Regulations application:</strong> after Planning Permission is granted, more detailed drawings and specification will be submitted on your behalf for the Building Regulations application. This entails fees to the council, architect's fee, and an engineer's fee if structural calculations are required. The council will normally take up to 8 weeks to give a decision on the Building Regulations Application.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Building work can commence</strong> after Building Regulations application is successful. Construction firms will usually require a copy of the Building Regulations drawing in order to provide an accurate quote for building work.</li>
</ul>
